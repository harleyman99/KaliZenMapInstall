# KaliZenMapInstall

I wrote this script to install ZenMap on Kali Linux. 

To use the script simply download it to your Kali Linux.

CD to the Downloads folder and make the script exacutable. 

sudo chmod 777 zenmap.sh

Run in the terminal ./zenmap.sh

Sit back and watch the magic happen.

Once it is completed simply reboot Kali.
